          I made a significant impact by providing crucial support to the Board of Directors in successfully raising Series A funding. Additionally, I took the lead in driving multiple refactoring initiatives for our existing product, resulting in enhanced scalability, improved ease of maintenance, and overall performance. These efforts significantly contributed to our continued growth and success.

          During this period, I gained valuable experience in developing a comprehensive process to determine whether to "build or outsource" specific projects. This involved evaluating factors such as cost, expertise, timeline, and strategic alignment to make informed decisions on resource allocation. Furthermore, I established an effective process for sourcing and monitoring the progress of outsourced projects aimed at supporting our core product. This ensured that these initiatives aligned with our objectives and met the desired standards of quality.
